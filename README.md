## Description of the project

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects, in it we are going to write a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects:

  *  Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
  *  Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
   * Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
   * Update attributes of an object
   * Destroy an object

## Installation

To use our AirBnB clone console you need to:
```git clone https://github.com/youssefboussaid/AirBnB_clone.git```



Use  the command interpreter hbnb in an interactive mode:
`
./console.py
`
`
  (hbnb)  (command)
`


Use hbnb in non-interactive mode too by:
`echo "command" | ./console.py`
